            <p class="paragraph">Since the foundation of the European Union, its aim has always been to create a peaceful, efficient and economically stable unity of countries. To achieve this higher purpose a joint budget was set up and each EU state pays its contribution to this account. This huge piggy pank is then smashed and redistributed aiming for the best progress of the continent as a whole. We aim to visualise the absolute contributions and expenses to the EU budget and intent to analyse in what ways the redistribution of state money makes the EU flourish. </p>

            <p class="paragraph">Up until now we have shown the loss and gain from EU's centralization and money distribution in a very factual manner. Spending and collecting money is not the goal of the Union, so to analyse the real losses and benefits, we have to follow the money and see how the EU has evaluated over time.  
               A lot of its benefits lay in non-quantitave matters like peace, stability, freedom and inclusion.  </p>
